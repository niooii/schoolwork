## Proposition 9.7

(ii) If $f : A \to B$ is surjective and $g : B \to C$ is surjective then $g \circ f : A \to C$ is surjective.  

**Proof.**  

Let $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ be surjective functions.  
This implies  
$(\forall b\in B)\text{ } (\exists a \in A) \text{ } f(a)=b$  and $(\forall c\in C)\text{ } (\exists b \in B) \text{ } g(b)=c$  
respectively.  

We need to prove that $g \circ f : A \to C$ is also surjective.  
In other words, we need to prove that  $(\forall c\in C)\text{ } (\exists a \in A) \text{ } g(f(a))=c$  


(iii) If $f : A \to B$ is bijective and $g : B \to C$ is bijective then $g \circ f : A \to C$ is bijective.  



## Proposition 9.10

(ii) $f$ is surjective if and only if $f$ has a right inverse.  

(iii) $f$ is bijective if and only if $f$ has an inverse.  

## Proposition 9.11

If a function is bijective then it's inverse is unique.  

## Proposition 9.14

We want to embed $Z$ into $R$. To do this, we define an injective function $e : Z \to R$ as follows:  

(i) Define $e$ on $Z_{\geq 0}$ recursively: $e(0_Z) := 0_R$ and, assuming $e(n)$ defined for a fixed $n \in Z_{\geq 0}$, define  
$e(n + 1_Z) := e(n) + 1_R$.  

(ii) If $k \in Z$ and $k < 0$, define $e(k) := -e(-k)$.  

**Prove:**  
(i) $e(1_Z) = 1_R$  
(ii) $e(-1_Z) = -1_R$  

## Proposition 9.15

If $k \in \mathbb{N}$ then $e(k) \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$  

## Project 9.13

Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$. Decide whether each of the following is true or false; in each case prove the statement or give a counterexample.  

(i) If $f$ is injective and $g$ is surjective then $g \circ f$ is surjective.  



(ii) If $g \circ f$ is bijective then $g$ is surjective and $f$ is injective.
