Prove Thm. 13.14, Cors. 13.18, 13.23, Thm. 13.28

## Theorem 13.14  
$\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$ is countable.  

## Corollary 13.18  
$\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.  

**Proof.**  

Idk use Corollary 13.17 that states $\mathbb{Z}\times (\mathbb{Z}-\{0\})$ is countable. Since the rationals can be constructed from this set.  

## Corollary 13.23  
The set $\mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}$ of irrational numbers is uncountable.  

**Proof.**  
Use Theorem 13.22 that $\R$ is not countable if i were to guess.  

## Corollary 13.28  
All open intervals have the same cardinality.  

**Proof.**  
Use Theorem 13.25 that every open interval $(a,b)$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$.
