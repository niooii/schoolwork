## Proposition 13.1  
There exists no bijection $[1]\to [n]$ when $n>1$.  

**Proof.**  

We revisit the definition of a function:  
A function $A\to B$, is really a set $\Gamma\subset(A\times B)$ such that for each $a\in A$ there is **one and only one** element of $\Gamma$ whose first entry is $a$.  

Let $f : [1]\to [n]$.  $[1]$ is defined as $\{1\}$, so $f : \{1\}\to [n]$.  
This function $f$ can be rewritten as the set $\Gamma_f\subset (\{1\}\times [n])$, where there must exist one and only one entry with $1$ as the first element.  
Therefore, the only valid sets for $\Gamma_f$ are $\{(1, b)\}$, for some arbitrary $b\in [n]$.  
By definition of $[n]$, when $n>1$, $\{1, 2\}\subseteq [n]$.

## Proposition 13.3
If $1 \leq k \leq n$ then the function

$$g_k : [n-1] \to [n]-\{k\}$$

defined by

$$g_k(j) := 
\begin{cases}
j & \text{if } j < k, \\
j+1 & \text{if } j \geq k
\end{cases}$$

is a bijection.  

## Proposition 13.6  
Every subset of a finite set is finite.  

## Proposition 13.13  
$\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.  

**Proof.**  

We construct a bijection $f : \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$.  

We define $f$ as follows:  

| $x$   | $f(x)$ |
| ----- | ------ |
| $1$   | $0$    |
| $2$   | $-1$   |
| $3$   | $1$    |
| $4$   | $-2$   |
| $5$   | $2$    |
| $...$ | $...$  |

Or more formally:  
$$f(x) := 
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-1}{2} & \text{if } x \text{ is even}, \\
\frac{x}{2} & \text{if } x \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}$$  

**Prove: $f$ is injective.**  
**Prove: $f$ is surjective.**  

Since $f$ is injective and surjective, by definition, it is bijective.  

**QED.**
