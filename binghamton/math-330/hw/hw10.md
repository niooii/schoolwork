## Proposition 6.5
Assume we are given an equivalence relation on a set A. For all $a, b\in A$:  
$[a] = [b] \text{ or } [a] \cap [b] =\empty$  

**Proof.**  
It suffices to prove that the two statement are mutually exclusive, and that if one is false, than the other must be true.  

Prove that $[a] = [b] \text{ and } [a] \cap [b] =\empty$ cannot both be true.  

$[a] \text{ and } [b]$ are equivalence classes, and equivalence classes are sets. We know these sets are nonempty, because proposition 6.4 states that $a\in [a]$ for any equivalence class $[a]$.  
Since $[a] = [b]$, $[a] \cap [b] = [a] \cap [a] = [a]$, and we know $[a]\neq \empty$.  
$\therefore [a] = [b] \text{ and } [a] \cap [b] =\empty$ cannot both be true.  

Now, prove that if one statement is false, then the other must be true.  

By definition, $[a] = \{x\in A \text{ | } x\sim a\}$, and $[b] = \{x\in A \text{ | } x\sim b\}$  
Using the definitions, $[a] \cap[b] = \{x\in A \text{ | } x\sim a \text{ and } x\sim b\}$  

Case 1: Assume $[a]\neq [b]$.  Prove $[a] \cap [b] = \empty$.  

By proposition 6.4(ii), since $[a]\neq[b]$, $a\nsim b$  
The statements $x\sim a \text{ and } x\sim b$ cannot both be true, as both being true would imply by transitivity that $a\sim b$, which we know is false. Therefore, no element $x\in A$ satisfies the constraints of $[a] \cap[b]$.  
$\therefore [a] \cap[b] = \empty$  

Case 2: Assume $[a] \cap [b] \neq \empty$.  Prove $[a] = [b]$.  

If $[a] \cap [b]\neq \empty$, then there must exist some $x\in A$ that satisfies both statements $x\sim a \text{ and } x\sim b$. If $x\sim a$ and $x\sim b$, then by transitivity, $a\sim b$. By proposition 6.4(ii), since $a\sim b$, $[a]=[b]$.  
$\therefore [a]=[b]$  

**QED.**  

## Proposition 6.6
Given an equivalence relation on A, its equivalence classes form a partition of A. Conversely, given a partition $\Pi$ of A, deﬁne $\sim$ by a $\sim$ b if and only if a and b lie in the same element of $\Pi$. Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.  

## Project 6.7
For each of the following relations deﬁned on $\mathbb{Z}$, determine whether it is an equivalence relation. If it is, determine the equivalence classes.  

### (ii) $x\sim y$ if $x\leq y$
No, because the relation $x\leq y$ is not symmetric — $x\leq y$ does not imply $y\leq x$.   

### (iii) $x\sim y$ if $|x| = |y|$
Yes, because the relation $|x| = |y|$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  
$|x| = |x|$, therefore it is reflexive.  
$|x| = |y|$ $\iff$ $|y| = |x|$, therefore it is symmetric.  
$|x| = |y|$ and $|y| - |z|$ $\iff$ $|x| = |z|$, therefore it is transitive.  

$[a] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ | } |a| = |x|\} = \{a, -a\}$  

### (iv) $x\sim y$ if $x \neq y$  
No, because the relation $x \neq y$ is not reflexive — $x\neq x$ is false.  

## Project 6.8
Prove that each of the following relations deﬁned on $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ is an equivalence relation. Determine the equivalence classes for each relation.  

## (i) $(x,y)\sim (v,w)$ if $x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2$  
The relation is an equivalence relation because the relation $x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  
$x^2+y^2=x^2+y^2$, therefore it is reflexive.  
$x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2 \iff v^2+w^2=x^2+y^2$,  therefore it is symmetric.    
$x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2$ and $v^2+w^2=a^2+b^2$ $\iff$ $x^2+y^2=a^2+b^2$,  therefore it is transitive.    

## (ii) $(x,y)\sim (v,w)$ if $y-x^2=w-v^2$


## (iii) $(x,y)\sim (v,w)$ if $xy=vw$
