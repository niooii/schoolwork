# Do Project 5.3 using def. of set equality. Do Projects 5.5, 5.12(i,ii), 5.16(ii), 5.21(i), and 5.4A(a,b). Prove Props. 5.14, 5.20(ii).

> **Project 5.3.**  

Define the following sets:  
$A := \{3x : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$
$B := \{3x + 21 : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$
$C := \{x + 7 : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$
$D := \{3x : x \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } x > 7\}$
$E := \{x : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$
$F := \{3x - 21 : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$
$G := \{x : x \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } x > 7\}$

Determine which of the following set equalities are true. If a statement is true, prove it. If it is false, explain why this set equality does not hold.

(i) $D = E$  
(ii) $C = G$  
(iii) $D = B$  

> **Project 5.5.**  

When reading or writing a set definition, pay attention to what is a variable inside the set definition and what is not a variable. As examples, how do the following pairs of sets differ?

$S := \{m : m \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $T_m := \{m\}$ for a specified $m \in \mathbb{N}$.  

$U := \{my : y \in \mathbb{Z}, m \in \mathbb{N}, my > 0\}$ and $V_m := \{my : y \in \mathbb{Z}, my > 0\}$ for a specified $m \in \mathbb{N}$.  

$V_m$ and $W_m := \{my : y \in \mathbb{Z}, y > 0\}$ for a specified $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.  

> **Functions: 5.4A(a)**  

A function $g:X\rightarrow Y$ is defined as follows:  

|    $x$    | $g(x)$ |
| :-------: | :----: |
|    cat    |   3    |
| squirrel  |   0    |
| sunflower |   1    |
|   grass   |   4    |

What is the domain, $\text{Dom}(g)$?

What is the codomain, $\text{Codom}(g)$?

What is the image, $\text{Im}(g)$?

Is $g$ injective (one-to-one)?

Is $g$ surjective (onto)?

Is $g$ bijective (a one-to-one correspondence)?

A function $h:X\rightarrow Y$ is defined as follows:

| squirrel  |   0    |
| sunflower |   1    |
|   grass   |   4    |

What is the domain, $\text{Dom}(h)$?

What is the codomain, $\text{Codom}(h)$?

What is the image, $\text{Im}(h)$?

Is $h$ injective (one-to-one)?

Is $h$ surjective (onto)?
