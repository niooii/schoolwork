# Prove Prop. 2.18(ii) by induction. (F 2/14)

> **Prop. 2.18(ii).**  
> $\forall k\in\mathbb{N}, \space k^3+5k$ is divisible by 6.

Proof.  
`Comment: can i omit this, since the def is from chapter 1?`  
$m$ is divisible by $n$ if there exists an $j\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $m=jn$.  

$P(k)=k^3+5k$ is divisible by 6.  

Prove $P(1)$.  
$(1)^3+5(1)=1+5=6$.  
$6$ is divisible by $6$, therefore $P(1)$ is true.
