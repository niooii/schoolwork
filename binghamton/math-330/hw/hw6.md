# Do Projects 2.35 for (4,6), 3.3, 3.7, Extras #1(a-e). Prove Props. 2.23, 2.18.1(iii,iv).   

> **Project 2.35.**  
> Compute $gcd(4,6)$.  

> **Project 3.3.**  
> Construct two more mathematical if-then statements that are true, but whose converses are false.  

$1)$ If $f$ is differentiable, then $f$ is continuous.  
$2)$ If $f$ is a contravariant functor, then $f$ is a functor.   

> **Project 3.7.**  
> Negate the following statements.  

**$(i)$ Every cubic polynomial has a real root.**  
Every cubic polynomial does not have a real root.  
**$(ii)$ $G$ is normal and $H$ is regular.**  
$G$ is not normal and $H$ is not regular.  
**$(iii)$ $\exists!0$ such that $\forall x$, $x + 0 = x$.**  

**$(iv)$ The newspaper article was neither accurate nor entertaining.**  
**$(v)$ If $gcd(m, n)$ is odd, then $m$ or $n$ is odd.** 
**$(vi)$ $H/N$ is a normal subgroup of $G/N$ if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.**  
**$(vii)$ For each $ε > 0$ there exists $N ∈ \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n ≥ N$, $|a_n − L| < ε$.**   

> **Extras 1a-1e.**  

$a)$ P and Q are statements. What is the difference among "P if Q", "P is necessary for Q", and "P only if Q"?  

$b)$ Write the inverse, converse, and contrapositive of the following statement: "There can't be rain if there is no water."  

$c)$ Consider the statement "All apples are pears." Formulate it as an implication P ⇒ Q (say what P and Q are). Then state the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of your implication. Which of the four statements are true and which are false? Explain why.  

$d)$ Consider the statement "No apples are pears." Formulate it as an implication R ⇒ S (say what R and S are). Then state the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of your implication.  

$e)$ Compare the implications of parts c and d. Are they different? Why, or why not?  

> **Prop. 2.23.**  
> Let $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$. If $n$ is divisible $m$ then $m\leq n$.  

> **Prop. 2.18.1(iii).**  
> The sum $1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.  

> **Prop. 2.18.1(iii).**  
> $6 \space | \space n(n+1)(2n+1)$
