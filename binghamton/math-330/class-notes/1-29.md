> If $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and m and n are both even, then $m+n$ is even.

<summary>Proof.</summary>

Assume $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ are even.  

The definition of an *even* integer is as follows:
> If $a$ is even, then $\exists b \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $a=b*2$.

By definition, $\exists j, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $m=j*2$ and $n=k*2$.

- $m+n=j*2+k*2$, by substitution
- $2j+2k=(j+k)*2$, by prop. 1.6

$(j+k) \in \mathbb{Z}$, as $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition.

We have derived $m+n=(j+k)*2$, and $(j+k) \in \mathbb{Z}$, therefore $m+n$ is even.
