**Different cultures valued different knowledge.**  
> Science and technology was uniquely valued because it granted **power over other civilizations**.  

- Example: Chinese fleets sunk during opium war.  
- Economic power.
- Military power.

### A broader view of the rise of modern science
Several developments converged:
- Long term development: the migration and translation of learning across cultures (Greek ⇾ Europe etc.).
- New growth of learning: printing (15th century Europe) and humanism.
- Diversified religious and cultural authority: ex, the Reformation.
- Technology: mechanical clock (precision, measurement), and military tech.
- Age of exploration: voyages of discovery, new geography, people, etc. 
> **Not having central authority** allowed many people to challenge each other, allowing for **many competing ideas** to flourish.  

> **New world ⇾ new knowledge**.

**Economic expansion intertwined with science and tech:**  
- Mining
- Commerce
- Shipping
- Banking
- War

### New approaches to knowledge
**Empiricism**: Francis Bacon's ***induction***.  
**Rationalism**: René Descartes's ***deduction***.  
**Experimentation**:  
- "Seeing is believing"
- Demonstration is a method of persuasion. 
- Importance of instrumentation
- Labs as a site of knowledge production.  

Skinned people to learn more about anatomy lol
